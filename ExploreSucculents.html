        <div class="column">
          <p>
            Haworthia resemble mini aloe plants. They are endemic to Southern
            Africa and have clusters of pointed fleshy leaves that grow in
            rosette shapes. Common names include Zebra cactus, pearl, star
            window, and cushion aloe. To cultivate Haworthia, plant in well
            draining soil and avoid overwatering. Water when the top one inch of
            soil is dry. Place in bright, indirect sunlight. Propagate in spring
            or early summer and repot when overgrown.To cultivate, divide the
            offsets of new plants growing from the base of the parent plant.
            Place the offsets in clean water and change the water every few days
            when it gets dirty. Once the roots establish, plant the baby plants
            in sandy soil.

            Graptoveria plants are perennial hybrids of Echeveria and
            Graptopetalum succulents that have colorful, waxy looking leaves.
            Graptoveria grows best in in south or west facing windows of bright
            sunlight. Plant in well draining soil in pots with drainage holes.
            Water them every 2 to 3 weeks once soil is dry. Cultivation can
            occur from seeds, young plants, or cuttings.

            Kalanchoe is a tropical succulent known for its tiny flowers and
            oval shaped, scalloped-edged leaves. They belong to the stonecrop
            family and grow best indoors. Plant them in sandy, well-draining
            soil with peat moss and perlite. Kalanchoe grows best in warm, full
            sun places. Water when the top 2 inches of soil is dry. Prune dead
            leaves and propagate by breaking off pieces and sticking them in
            soil to form roots.

            chlorophyll constaining stems. Cacti are native to the Americas and
            store water in their stems. Cacti grow best in 4-6 hours of direct
            sunlight daily. Water every 2-3 weeks in the summer and every 4-6
            weeks in the winter. Pot in well-draining soil with sand and
            perlite. Fertilize with phosphorous-rich fertilizer 2-3 times a
            year.

            season and fertilize in the beginning of the growing season. Repot
            once they outgrow their pot. Sempervivum are frost-resistant and
            grow great outdoors. They can make great ground cover and are
            extremely hardy.
